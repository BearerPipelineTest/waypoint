  A brief overview about on-demand runners and their role in Waypoint.

# On-Demand Runners

On-demand runners allow a single Waypoint installation to scale very high by
leveraging the defined platform to spawn resources to execute Waypoint jobs
remotely. Through on-demand runner profiles and runner targeting, Waypoint can
even utilize resources from other platforms that Waypoint has access to. For
example, a local Kubernetes server install could be configured to use Amazon ECS
to execute jobs.

## Job Assignment

When a job is submitted to the server, if on-demand runners are enabled, it
will spawn an on-demand runner and the job is placed in a holding set. This is
the same mechanism we use for automatic CLI runners. When the on-demand
runner starts, it will execute the normal Waypoint runner code and connect back
to the server. On connection, the server will see the job in the holding set
and send it immediately to the new runner.

The flow of information about the job uses the normal grpc runner APIs so all
the input and output remain the same as if the work were performed by the
CLI-runner.

Upon finishing the job, the on-demand runner will exit and the platform it runs
on will reclaim its resources.

### Launching Tasks to Execute Jobs

When Waypoint goes to launch an on-demand runner task, it will generate three
jobs:

- `StartJob`
- `TaskJob`
- `StopJob`

The start job is responsible for scheduling a resource in the platform to execute
the assigned job. Once that resource exists, it will be a `TaskJob` that is
responsible for actually running the assigned job. Once it's complete, the task
plugin system will launch a stop job to clean up the launched platform resource.

### On-Demand Runner Tracking

The on-demand runner tasks that Waypoint launches can be examined through the CLI.
The command `waypoint task list` will show you an inventory of Waypoint ODR tasks
that have been launched:

```terminal-output
$ waypoint task list

» Waypoint On-Demand Runner Tasks
              ID             | RUN JOB OPERATION | TASK STATE |    PROJECT     |  TIME CREATED  | TIME COMPLETED
-----------------------------+-------------------+------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------
  01G669RE32WM0JBBGZW3JETYSJ | Build             | STOPPED    | example-go     | 32 minutes ago | 31 minutes ago
  01G669R0PDA7BQZYJA1P2GK8CX | Init              | STOPPED    | example-go     | 32 minutes ago | 32 minutes ago
  01G669MY6W92YMARAQFFZD1WRC | Build             | STOPPED    | example-nodejs | 34 minutes ago | 33 minutes ago
  01G6687Z8W82GQMSEEZR1R0AF9 | Build             | STOPPED    | example-nodejs | 58 minutes ago | 58 minutes ago
  01G6686GHKREG41C79Z94010EC | Init              | STOPPED    | example-nodejs | 59 minutes ago | 59 minutes ago
```

You can also take a closer look at an individual task using `waypoint task inspect`.
This will provide information about the on-demand runner profile which ran the job,
the job which executed the operation (the Run Job), as well as the job which was
watching the Run Job (the Watch Job).

In the example below, you can see that the Run Job which the task was running returned
an error, with some helpful information about what happened:

```terminal-output
waypoint task inspect 01G669RE32WM0JBBGZW3JETYSJ

  Error Messsage: There was an error while executing a Waypoint plugin for this operation!

One or more required arguments for the plugin was not satisfied. This is usually due to a missing or incompatible set of plugins. For example, only certain build plugins are only compatible with certain registries, and so on. Please inspect the missing argument, the set
of plugins you are using, and the documentation to determine if your plugin combination is valid.

## On-Demand Runner Profiles

Users can configure Waypoint server to launch on-demand runners with specific
configurations. These configurations are set through on-demand runner profiles.
See [runner profiles](/docs/runner/profiles) for more information.

## OCI/Docker Image

By default, the server will launch on-demand runners using the same OCI image
it was configured with. The on-demand configuration will also accept a specific
OCI image url to use instead. This allows operators the ability to prepackage
any Waypoint plugins into the image and use them in their configuration.

The official on-demand runner container image is built very similar to Waypoint
server, with some additional packages such as `Kaniko` for doing in-container
builds for jobs like the `Build` operation.

See the [runner profile docs on OCI URLs](/docs/runner/profiles#oci-url) for more information.

## Official Waypoint Supported Task Plugin Platforms

When you use the `waypoint server install` command, we automatically set up a
default On-Demand runner profile for you to use with Waypoint Server. Like our
server install platform support, we also currently support these platforms
for launching on-demand runner tasks:

- [Kubernetes](/plugins/kubernetes#kubernetes-task)
- [HashiCorp/Nomad](/plugins/nomad#nomad-task)
- [AWS/ECS](/plugins/aws-ecs#aws-ecs-task)
- [Docker](/plugins/docker#docker-task)

## Adding on-demand runner support for other platforms

On-demand runner support can be implemented for additional platforms
using the [plugin SDK](/docs/extending-waypoint).

Plugins expect to fulfill the SDK interface with the following functions:

- `StartTask`
- `StopTask`

These functions are what will launch and stop the spawned resource with the
task launcher.

Task plugins also can accept `TaskLauncherConfig` configuration which users can
configure through an [on-demand runner profile](/docs/runner/profiles).

## Task Introspection

In Waypoint 0.9.0, we introduced the CLI command `waypoint task`. This command
currently gives users more introspection into the task launcher system and
what Waypoint is doing with remote-enabled projects. The simplest benefit
to this command is listing all known tasks in the system:

```shell
$ waypoint task list

» Waypoint On-Demand Runner Tasks
              ID             | RUN JOB OPERATION | TASK STATE |   PROJECT   |  TIME CREATED  | TIME COMPLETED
-----------------------------+-------------------+------------+-------------+----------------+-----------------
  01G1RYP6JFSEAQVE2SQX38Q19D | Up                | RUNNING    | go-gitops-0 | 3 seconds ago  |
  01G1RYP37X5FTD9TFZQE5J2BQM | QueueProject      | STOPPED    | go-gitops-0 | 7 seconds ago  | 3 seconds ago
  01G1RYP08Z9V18HMBP5XDPP0KA | Poll              | STOPPED    | go-gitops-0 | 10 seconds ago | 6 seconds ago
  01G1RYNTQJ5421K3QBYR6FPAZP | Init              | STOPPED    | go-gitops-0 | 15 seconds ago | 12 seconds ago

```

This will display a list of all known Tasks in Waypoint server. It will show
the current state of the task as well.
